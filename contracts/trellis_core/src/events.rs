use soroban_sdk::{symbol_short, Address, BytesN, Env, String};

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Event emitters — the only place that calls env.events().publish().
//
// Convention:
//   • topics: a tuple of (Symbol, agreement_id) — enables indexed filtering
//     by event name and/or agreement ID from off-chain indexers.
//   • data:   a tuple of typed Soroban primitives (Symbol, i128, Address, u32,
//     bool, Option<String>) so off-chain consumers can decode payloads without
//     importing the contract WASM types.
//
// Symbol length limits:
//   • `symbol_short!` accepts ≤9 characters and stores the symbol as an
//     inline 64-bit integer — no heap allocation on the guest WASM side.
//   • `symbol_short!` is used where the prefixed name is exactly 9 chars or
//     fewer.  Any name that exceeds 9 chars uses `Symbol::new(env, "…")`,
//     which stores the string in the host's symbol table.
//
// Prefixed topic names and their lengths:
//   1. "trls_crte"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — agreement_created  (abbreviated to stay ≤9)
//   2. "trls_lckd"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — funds_locked       (abbreviated)
//   3. "trls_sbmt"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — work_submitted     (abbreviated)
//   4. "trls_rlsd"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — funds_released     (abbreviated)
//   5. "trls_dspt"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — dispute_raised     (abbreviated)
//   6. "trls_rslv"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — milestone_resolved (abbreviated)
//   7. "trls_cncl"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — milestone_cancelled(abbreviated)
//   8. "trls_ttle"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — ttl_extended       (abbreviated)
//   9. "trls_prtl"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — funds_partially_released (abbreviated)
//  10. "trls_cmpl"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — agreement_completed (abbreviated)
//  11. "trls_ddln"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — deadline_set       (abbreviated)
//  12. "trls_expd"  ( 9 chars) → symbol_short! — milestone_expired  (abbreviated)
//
// All abbreviations follow the pattern: drop the vowels from the root word
// while keeping enough consonants to be unambiguous.  They are intentional
// and documented here so indexers can rely on them as stable identifiers.
//
// Event schema (topics → data):
//   1. "created"   → (payer: Address, payee: Address)
//   2. "locked"    → (milestone_id: u32, amount: i128)
//   3. "submitted" → (milestone_id: u32, proof_uri: Option<String>)
//   4. "released"  → (milestone_id: u32, amount: i128)
//   5. "disputed"  → (milestone_id: u32, caller: Address)
//   6. "resolved"  → (milestone_id: u32, payer_amount: i128, payee_amount: i128)
//   7. "cancelled" → (milestone_id: u32, payer: Address, cancelled_by: Address)
//   8. "ttl_extended" → (caller: Address)
//   9. "partially_released" → (milestone_id: u32, amount: i128, remaining: i128)
//  10. "agreement_completed" → (completed_count: u32, refunded_count: u32)
//  11. "deadline_set" → (milestone_id: u32, deadline: u64)
//  12. "expired"   → (milestone_id: u32, refunded_amount: i128, caller: Address)
//
// Schema changes: the `amount` field on "disputed", "resolved" and
// "cancelled" was appended as the last tuple element, so an indexer that
// decodes those payloads positionally keeps reading the earlier fields at
// the same indices. Every fund-movement event now carries an amount.
//
// `amount` semantics: on "released", "disputed" and "resolved" it is the
// amount still held in escrow for the milestone at the time of the call —
// the milestone's configured `amount` minus anything already paid out via
// `release_partial`. With no partial releases this equals the milestone's
// stored amount. On "cancelled" it is the proposed (never funded) amount.
//
// "trls_rslv" and "trls_cncl" are deliberately distinct: an indexer must be
// able to tell an arbitrated dispute outcome apart from a payer walking back a
// milestone that was never funded, since only the former involves token
// movement and resolver involvement.
